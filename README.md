# Knowledge

This is a repository for putting as much stuff as I know into hopefully an understandable package.

This idea came I found at [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz).

## How to run

`npx gitbook-cli build`

## Make your own wiki

You can view other similar to this, continuously updated wikis, [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge#readme).

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.
